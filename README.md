Browse Bazar is a full-stack e-commerce platform developed using ASP.NET, SQL Server, and CSS. This platform supports multiple user roles (Admin, Seller, Customer), each with specific functionalities. It allows sellers to manage their products, customers to browse and purchase items, and includes an OTP-verified registration system for user authentication. The platform also features an integrated cart and checkout system, ensuring a smooth and secure shopping experience for all users.
Key Features:

Multi-User Support: Separate functionalities for Admin, Seller, and Customer roles.

Product Management: Sellers can add, update, and delete products.

Cart and Checkout: Customers can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.

OTP Verification: Secure user registration with OTP validation.

Database: SQL Server is used to store user, product, and order details.

This project was developed during a 3-month mentorship at Persistent Systems, where I gained valuable experience in full-stack web development and Agile project management.
